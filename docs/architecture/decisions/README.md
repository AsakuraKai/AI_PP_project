# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **Purpose:** Document all major architectural decisions with rationale, consequences, and alternatives considered.

---

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. This creates an audit trail of "why" decisions were made, not just "what" was decided.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Technology choices (frameworks, libraries, databases)
- System architecture patterns
- API designs
- Security implementations
- Performance trade-offs
- Data structures
- Integration strategies
- Development workflow changes

## ADR Naming Convention

`YYYYMMDD-short-title.md`

Example: `20250115-dual-llm-provider-strategy.md`

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Decision under consideration
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated** - Decision no longer recommended but still in use
4. **Superseded** - Decision replaced by a new ADR

| 003 | ChromaDB for Vector Storage | 2025-12-14 | Accepted | REQ-004 |

*Note: ADRs 001-003 documented in DEVLOG.md during planning phase. Formal ADR documents to be created in Week 1.*

## ADR Template

Use the template in `ADR-TEMPLATE.md` when creating new ADRs.

## Archive

Superseded or deprecated ADRs are moved to the `archive/` subdirectory but kept for historical reference.
