## 📚 Why These Files Were Archived

**Reason for Consolidation:**
- Too many separate testing documents (3 files → 1 file)
- Redundant information across files
- Difficult to track which file contains what
- Better user experience with single comprehensive doc

**What Was Kept:**
- All information preserved in TESTING_COMPLETE.md
- Machine-readable JSON files kept in data/ folder
- No data loss, just better organization
