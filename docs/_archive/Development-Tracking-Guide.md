## 🏗️ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Location:** `docs/architecture/decisions/`  
**Purpose:** Document significant architectural and design decisions  
**Template:** Use `ADR-TEMPLATE.md` when creating new ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

- Choosing between different architectural patterns
- Selecting libraries or frameworks
- Defining API contracts or interfaces
- Making trade-off decisions (performance vs. simplicity)
- Establishing coding standards or conventions

### ADR Naming Convention

```
ADR-{number}-{short-title}.md
Examples:
- ADR-001-use-ollama-for-local-llm.md
- ADR-002-tool-registry-pattern.md
```

---

## ✅ Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Configuration

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,              // Enable all strict checks
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  }
}
```

### Testing Standards

- **Coverage Target:** >80% overall, >90% for critical components
- **Test Structure:** Unit tests + Integration tests + E2E tests
- **Naming:** `ComponentName.test.ts`
- **Framework:** Jest with TypeScript

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Coverage meets target (>80%)
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Documentation updated (JSDoc for public APIs)
- [ ] DEVLOG.md updated
- [ ] traceability.md updated (if adding requirements)

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarking

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
npm run bench

# Output: Performance metrics JSON
# - p50, p90, p99 latencies
# - Memory usage
# - Cache hit rates
```

### Performance Targets (Phase 1)

| Mode | Target | Hardware |
|------|--------|----------|
| Standard | <60s | RTX 3070 Ti |
| Fast | <40s | RTX 3070 Ti |
| Educational | <90s | RTX 3070 Ti |

---

## 🔄 Continuous Integration (Future)

### Pre-commit Hooks (To be implemented)

```bash
# Planned automation
- Run linter
- Run unit tests
- Check code coverage
- Validate documentation links
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

### Key Principles

1. **Document as you code** - Update DEVLOG.md weekly
2. **Test everything** - Maintain >80% coverage
3. **Track requirements** - Update traceability.md when adding features
4. **Record decisions** - Create ADRs for significant choices
5. **Automate when possible** - Use scripts for repetitive tasks

### Code Quality Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Coverage >80%
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] DEVLOG.md entry added (if weekly update)

---

## 📋 Tool Contracts Format

All tools must be documented in `API_CONTRACTS.md` with:

- Tool name and purpose
- Input/output schemas (JSON)
- Example usage
- Validation status

See [API_CONTRACTS.md](API_CONTRACTS.md) for full details.

- Functions implemented with full signatures
- Architecture decisions with rationale
- Blockers encountered and solutions
- Performance metrics vs targets
- Next week's goals

#### 2️⃣ **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Codebase Snapshot
**What:** Auto-generated file tree with metadata  
**When:** Updated at each milestone (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)  
**Contains:**
- Complete directory structure
- File purposes (from JSDoc headers)
- Exported functions/classes per file
- Dependencies (import statements)
- Last modified date and author
- Line count and test coverage

- Output schema (return values)
- Example usage (request/response)
- Validation status (Zod schema check)
- Version history

#### 4️⃣ **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Design Rationale
**What:** Individual markdown files per major decision  
**When:** Created when architectural choices made  
**Location:** `docs/architecture/decisions/YYYYMMDD-name.md`  
**Contains:**
- Context (why decision needed)
- Decision made
- Consequences (pros/cons)
- Alternatives considered
- Implementation details

#### 5️⃣ **Traceability Matrix** - Requirement Tracking

### Quick Reference: "Where Do I Document X?"

| What You're Doing | Where to Document | When |
|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| Created new file | DEVLOG.md "Files Created" table | End of week |
| Added function | DEVLOG.md "Functions Implemented" table | End of week |
| Made architectural choice | New ADR in `docs/architecture/decisions/` | Immediately |
| Added/modified tool | API_CONTRACTS.md | When PR created |
| Fixed a bug | Git commit message (conventional) | When committing |
| Encountered blocker | DEVLOG.md "Blockers & Solutions" | End of week |
| Completed milestone | Milestone summary + DEVLOG.md | Milestone end |
| Performance regression | DEVLOG.md "Performance Metrics" | End of week |
| New dependency added | ADR + DEVLOG.md | Immediately |
| Refactored code | Git commit message + DEVLOG.md note | When committing |

## Benefits of This System

✅ **Future-Proof:** New developers can onboard by reading DEVLOG.md chronologically  
✅ **Maintainable:** Understand "why" behind every decision via ADRs  
✅ **Traceable:** Every requirement tracked from specification to test  
✅ **Quality:** Automated scripts enforce documentation standards  
✅ **Transparent:** Clear audit trail for all changes  
✅ **Collaborative:** Documentation facilitates team coordination  
✅ **Debuggable:** Function signatures and purposes readily available  
✅ **Testable:** Traceability matrix ensures test coverage

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **"I'll document later"** → Document as you code  
❌ **"Code is self-documenting"** → Explain "why" not "what"  
❌ **"Skip DEVLOG this week"** → Breaks audit trail  
❌ **"No need for ADR"** → Future you will disagree  
❌ **"Tests can wait"** → Technical debt compounds  
❌ **"Quick fix without commit message"** → Lost context
