**What You're NOT Building Yet:**
- [FAIL] Vector database
- [FAIL] Multiple error types
- [FAIL] UI/Webview
- [FAIL] Educational mode
- [FAIL] Caching
- [FAIL] State persistence
- [FAIL] LSP integration
- [FAIL] Android-specific features

#### Lessons to Learn from MVP
After completing this chunk, you'll discover:
- Does the LLM reason well enough about Kotlin errors?
- Is 3 iterations enough or too few?
- What tools are actually essential?
- How accurate is root cause identification?
- Are your prompts effective?

**Decision Point:** If MVP doesn't work well, pivot before building more infrastructure!

## [CLIPBOARD] Quick Reference: Which Approach to Choose?

### Choose Option A (Traditional) if you:
- [DONE] Want to learn systematically and thoroughly
- [DONE] Prefer building solid foundations before moving forward
- [DONE] Have 12 weeks to dedicate (flexible pace)
- [DONE] Like structured learning with clear milestones
- [DONE] Don't mind waiting to see it work end-to-end

### Choose Option B (MVP-First) if you:
- [DONE] Want to see results in 2 weeks
- [DONE] Learn best by iterating on working prototypes
- [DONE] Want to validate LLM reasoning early
- [DONE] Prefer discovering problems through real use
- [DONE] More comfortable with refactoring as you learn

**Recommendation:** Try Option B first. If MVP works well in 2 weeks, you've validated the approach. If it doesn't, you've only invested 2 weeks instead of 8-12.

### Milestone 1.5 - Testing & Validation

**Deliverable:** Automated test suite for foundation components

#### Testing Strategy for LLM-Based Systems

**Challenge:** Non-deterministic LLM outputs make traditional assertions fail  
**Solution:** Quality criteria testing instead of exact string matching

```typescript
// tests/agent/ReactAgent.test.ts
describe('ReactAgent RCA Quality', () => {
  const kotlinNPEError = {
    type: 'runtime',
    message: 'kotlin.UninitializedPropertyAccessException: lateinit property viewModel has not been initialized',
    filePath: 'src/MainActivity.kt',
    line: 42,
    language: 'kotlin',
  };
  
  test('should identify root cause with >70% confidence', async () => {
    const rca = await agent.analyze(kotlinNPEError);
    
    // Don't assert exact wording, check quality criteria
    expect(rca.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.7);
    expect(rca.rootCause).toBeDefined();
    expect(rca.rootCause.length).toBeGreaterThan(50);
    expect(rca.fixGuidelines.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
  
  test('should include relevant code locations', async () => {
    const rca = await agent.analyze(kotlinNPEError);
    
    expect(rca.evidence).toContainEqual(
      expect.objectContaining({
        filePath: expect.stringContaining('.kt'),
        lineNumber: expect.any(Number),
      })
    );
  });
  
  test('should mention key concepts for lateinit errors', async () => {
    const rca = await agent.analyze(kotlinNPEError);
    const fullText = `${rca.rootCause} ${rca.fixGuidelines.join(' ')}`.toLowerCase();
    
    // Check for expected concepts (not exact phrases)
    const hasLateinit = fullText.includes('lateinit');
    const hasInitialization = fullText.includes('initializ');
    const hasLifecycle = fullText.includes('oncreate') || fullText.includes('lifecycle');
    
    expect(hasLateinit || hasInitialization).toBe(true);
    expect(hasLifecycle).toBe(true);
  });
  
  test('should complete within timeout', async () => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    await agent.analyze(kotlinNPEError, 'standard');
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(60000);  // <60s
  });
});
```

#### Golden Test Suite
**Approach:** Reference RCAs for common errors, validate new outputs against criteria

```typescript
// tests/golden/kotlin-npe.json
{
  "name": "Kotlin Lateinit NPE",
  "input": {
    "error": "kotlin.UninitializedPropertyAccessException: lateinit property viewModel has not been initialized",
    "file": "MainActivity.kt",
    "line": 42
  },
  "expected_elements": [
    "lateinit",
    "initialization",
    "onCreate",
    "lifecycle"
  ],
  "min_confidence": 0.75,
  "max_duration_ms": 60000,
  "should_mention_file": true
}
```

```typescript
// tests/golden/runner.ts
describe('Golden Test Suite', () => {
  const goldenTests = loadGoldenTests();
  
  goldenTests.forEach(test => {
    it(`should handle: ${test.name}`, async () => {
      const rca = await agent.analyze(test.input);
      
      // Validate expected elements present
      const fullText = `${rca.rootCause} ${rca.fixGuidelines.join(' ')}`.toLowerCase();
      test.expected_elements.forEach(element => {
        expect(fullText).toContain(element.toLowerCase());
      });
      
      // Validate quality criteria
      expect(rca.confidence).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(test.min_confidence);
    });
  });
});
```

#### Performance Regression Tests
```typescript
// tests/performance/benchmarks.test.ts
describe('Performance Benchmarks', () => {
  test('should complete standard analysis in <60s', async () => {
    const durations = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      const start = Date.now();
      await agent.analyze(sampleError, 'standard');
      durations.push(Date.now() - start);
    }
    
    const p90 = percentile(durations, 0.9);
    expect(p90).toBeLessThan(60000);
  });
});
```

| Task | Files Created | Coverage Target |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Unit Tests** | • `tests/unit/llm/ProviderFactory.test.ts`<br>• `tests/unit/db/ChromaDBClient.test.ts`<br>• `tests/unit/tools/*.test.ts` | 80%+ |

  }
}

// Language-specific parsers
// PHASE 1: Kotlin/Android parsers only

class KotlinErrorParser {

    // 2. Escape LLM control sequences
    clean = clean
      .replace(/```/g, '\\`\\`\\`')  // Prevent code injection
      .replace(/{/g, '\\{')  // Prevent JSON manipulation
      .replace(/}/g, '\\}');
    
    // 3. Length limit (prevent DOS via massive input)
    if (clean.length > 10000) {
      clean = clean.slice(0, 10000) + '\n[TRUNCATED]';
    }
    
    return clean;

## Week 5-8: Agent Intelligence

### Week 5: LLM Agent Core

#### Milestone 2.1 - ReAct Loop Implementation

**Deliverable:** Thought-Action-Observation loop with termination logic

| Task | Implementation Details | Files Created |
|------|----------------------|---------------|
| **2.1.1 Agent State Machine** | Manage iteration count, timeout, convergence detection | • `src/agent/ReactAgent.ts`<br>• `src/agent/AgentState.ts` |
| **2.1.2 Prompt Engine** | System prompts + few-shot examples | • `src/agent/PromptEngine.ts`<br>• `src/agent/prompts/system.ts`<br>• `src/agent/prompts/examples.ts` |
| **2.1.3 Tool Executor** | Parse LLM tool calls, execute, format observations | • `src/agent/ToolExecutor.ts` |

**Agent State Interface:**
```typescript
// src/agent/types.ts
export interface AgentState {
  iteration: number;
  maxIterations: number;  // Dynamic: 6-12 based on complexity
  startTime: number;
  timeout: number;  // 60000ms (standard), 90000ms (educational sync), 60000ms (educational async)
  mode: 'standard' | 'educational' | 'fast';
  educationalAsync: boolean;  // If true, generate explanations after analysis
  thoughts: string[];
  actions: ToolCall[];
  observations: ToolResult[];
  hypothesis: string | null;
  rootCause: string | null;
  converged: boolean;
  complexityScore: number;  // 0-1, determines iteration budget
  educationalExplanations: string[];  // Step-by-step learning notes (sync) or final (async)
  pendingExplanations: Array<{ thought: string; iteration: number }>;  // For async mode
  checkpointId?: string;  // For state persistence
}

export interface ToolCall {
  tool: string;
  parameters: Record<string, unknown>;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

**Educational Mode: Implementation Strategy**

#### Sync Mode (Real-Time Learning)
**When to use:** Learning priority > speed  
**Performance Impact:** +15-20s total (2s per iteration × 8 iterations)

```typescript
// Educational note generated DURING iteration
if (state.mode === 'educational' && !state.educationalAsync) {
  const explanation = await this.generateEducationalNote(thought, state);
  state.educationalExplanations.push(explanation);
  // Display immediately in UI before next iteration
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Agent generates thought
2. **Immediately** generate educational note (extra LLM call)
3. Display explanation in UI before next iteration
4. Continue analysis

#### Async Mode (Fast Analysis + Learning)
**When to use:** Speed priority, learn after  
**Performance Impact:** Same as standard mode (~60s), learning notes ready in +10-15s

```typescript
// Educational notes generated AFTER analysis completes
if (state.mode === 'educational' && state.educationalAsync) {
  state.pendingExplanations.push({ thought, iteration: state.iteration });
  // Continue immediately without waiting
}

// After analysis completes:
async generateEducationalContentAsync(state: AgentState): Promise<void> {
  for (const pending of state.pendingExplanations) {
    const explanation = await this.generateEducationalNote(
      pending.thought, 
      state
    );
    await this.updateUIWithExplanation(explanation, pending.iteration);
  }
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Run standard analysis (no educational notes)
2. Complete in ~60s
3. **Background task:** Generate educational content from thought history
4. Display learning notes when ready (~10-15s later)

**Recommendation:** Default to **Async Mode** for better UX (fast results + learning)

---

**ReAct Loop:**
```typescript
// src/agent/ReactAgent.ts
export class ReactAgent {
  async analyze(errorContext: ErrorContext, mode: 'standard' | 'educational' | 'fast' = 'standard'): Promise<RCADocument> {

      state.observations.push(...observations);
      
      // 4. SELF-REFLECTION: Evaluate hypothesis quality
      const reflection = await this.reflectOnHypothesis(state);

    );
  }

    // Generate beginner-friendly explanation of current reasoning
    const prompt = `Explain this debugging step to a junior developer: ${thought}`;
    return await this.llm.generate(prompt);
  }
  
  private async reflectOnHypothesis(state: AgentState): Promise<ReflectionResult> {

### Week 6: Prompt Engineering

#### Milestone 2.2 - System Prompts & Chain-of-Thought

**Deliverable:** Optimized prompts for RCA workflow

**System Prompt Structure:**
```typescript
// src/agent/prompts/system.ts
export const getSystemPrompt = (mode: 'standard' | 'educational' | 'fast') => `
You are an expert Root Cause Analysis agent for software errors.
Mode: ${mode.toUpperCase()}

${mode === 'educational' ? `
EDUCATIONAL MODE GUIDELINES:
- Explain each reasoning step in beginner-friendly terms
- Define technical terms when first used
- Show both "what" and "why" for each action
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Highlight common mistakes and how to avoid them
` : ''}

WORKFLOW:
1. HYPOTHESIS: Form initial theory about error cause
2. INVESTIGATE: Use tools to gather evidence
3. VALIDATE: Test hypothesis with code context and dependencies
4. REFLECT: Evaluate if evidence supports hypothesis, backtrack if needed
5. ITERATE: Refine understanding until root cause identified

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
${JSON.stringify(ToolRegistry.getAllTools(), null, 2)}

TERMINATION:
Stop when you have:
- Identified root cause with 80%+ confidence
- Traced error to specific file/line/function
- Found similar past solutions (if available)
- Validated hypothesis with code evidence

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "thought": "Current reasoning step",
  "action": {
    "tool": "tool_name",
    "parameters": { ... }
  },
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Or to finish:
{
  "thought": "Final analysis",
  "action": null,
  "root_cause": "Detailed explanation",
  "fix_guidelines": ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...]
}
`;

// Few-shot examples
export const FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = [
  {
    error: 'TypeError: Cannot read property "map" of undefined',
    workflow: [
      {
        thought: 'Error suggests accessing .map() on undefined value. Need to find where this occurs.',
        action: { tool: 'read_file', parameters: { filePath: 'error.stack.file' } },
      },
      {
        thought: 'Line 45 has `data.map()` but data comes from API response. Need to check API function.',
        action: { tool: 'find_callers_of_function', parameters: { functionName: 'fetchData' } },
      },
      // ... more steps
    ],
  },
];
```

### Week 7: Tool Ecosystem Completion

#### Milestone 2.3 - Advanced Tools

**Deliverable:** Full toolset with vector search, local documentation, and quality management

| Tool | Purpose | API Integration |
|------|---------|-----------------||
| **Vector Search** | Query past RCAs with quality filtering | ChromaDB semantic search + quality scores |
| **Local Docs Search** | Offline documentation lookup | Indexed MDN, Python docs, Kotlin docs, Android SDK, Jetpack Compose, Java docs, Flutter docs, Dart docs, XML layout reference, Gradle DSL, C++, Rust (later) |
| **Git Blame** | Find code authors | Git CLI wrapper |
| **Dependency Checker** | Verify package versions | npm/pip/gradle/go.mod APIs |
| **Fix Validator** | Verify suggested fixes compile | Language-specific syntax checkers |

```typescript
// src/tools/VectorSearchTool.ts
export const VectorSearchTool: ToolDefinition = {
  name: 'vector_search_db',
  description: 'Search past RCA solutions for similar errors',
  parameters: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe('Error description or stack trace'),
    language: z.string().optional(),
    limit: z.number().default(5),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query, language, limit }) => {
    const db = ChromaDBClient.getInstance();
    const results = await db.queryRelevantRCAs(query, limit);
    
    // Filter by language if specified
    const filtered = language 
      ? results.filter(r => r.metadata.language === language)
      : results;
    
    return {
      found: filtered.length,
      solutions: filtered.map(r => ({
        error: r.error_description,
        solution: r.solution,
        confidence: r.confidence,
      })),
    };
  },
};
```

### Week 8: End-to-End Testing

#### Milestone 2.4 - End-to-End RCA Workflow

**Deliverable:** First working RCA generation

**Phase 1 Test Coverage (Kotlin/Android Only):**

| Test Scenario | Input | Expected Output |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Kotlin NullPointerException** | `NullPointerException: lateinit property not initialized` | Root cause: lateinit accessed before init, Fix: Initialize in onCreate() |
| **Compose State Error** | `IllegalStateException: reading a state in composition` | Root cause: Improper state handling, Fix: Use remember { mutableStateOf() } |
| **XML Layout Inflation** | `InflateException: Binary XML file line #12` | Root cause: Missing view ID in XML, Fix: Add android:id attribute |
| **Gradle Build Error** | `Could not resolve dependency` | Root cause: Maven repository misconfigured, Fix: Add correct repository URL |
| **Android Lifecycle Error** | `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` in Fragment | Root cause: Accessing view before onViewCreated, Fix: Use viewLifecycleOwner |
| **Compose Recomposition** | Excessive recompositions slowing UI | Root cause: Unstable state, Fix: Use derivedStateOf or remember |
| **Kotlin Scope Function Misuse** | Unexpected null in `let` block | Root cause: Wrong scope function used, Fix: Use `?.let` or `run` instead |

**Performance Benchmarks (Your 3070 Ti):**

| Mode | Model | Quant | Per Iteration | Total (8 iter) | Status |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **NVIDIA GPU (8GB+)** | 7B | Q8 | 4-6s | 32-48s | Standard [DONE] |
| **Apple M1/M2 (16GB)** | 7B | Q8 | 6-8s | 48-64s | Standard [DONE] |
| **CPU (8-core)** | 7B | Q8 | 15-20s | 120-160s | Standard [YELLOW] |
| **CPU (8-core)** | 7B | Q4 | 10-12s | 80-96s | Standard [YELLOW] |
| **NVIDIA GPU (8GB+)** | 3B | Q8 | 2-3s | 16-24s | Fast [DONE] |
| **Apple M1/M2 (16GB)** | 7B | Q8 | 8-10s | 64-80s | Educational [DONE] |
| **CPU (4-core)** | 3B | Q4 | 8-10s | 64-80s | Fast [YELLOW] |

**Targets by Hardware:**
- **GPU/Apple Silicon:** <60s standard, <90s educational, <40s fast [DONE]
- **CPU-only (8-core):** <100s standard, <120s educational, <80s fast [YELLOW]
- **CPU-only (4-core):** Fast mode only (<80s) [YELLOW]

**Caching Impact:**
- First analysis: Full time (see above)
- Repeat similar error: 90% reduction (~5-10s via vector DB)
- Exact duplicate: 95% reduction (~2-5s from cache)

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use Q8 quantization for best quality/speed balance
- Enable GPU acceleration (2-4x faster than CPU)
- Use Fast Mode (3B) for quick feedback loops
- Implement result caching (huge wins on similar errors)

*Note: Benchmarks assume typical error complexity. Very complex errors may use 10-12 iterations.*

## [LEARN] Learning Notes

### Why This Error Happened
[Beginner-friendly explanation]

### Key Concepts
- **Optional Chaining (?.):** Safely access nested properties
- **Nullish Coalescing (??):** Provide default values
- **Type Guards:** Runtime checks for type safety

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Assuming API responses always succeed
2. Not handling edge cases (null, undefined, empty arrays)
3. Skipping error boundaries in UI components

### Practice Exercise
Try refactoring this similar pattern in your codebase:

### Error Handling & Graceful Degradation Strategy

**Deliverable:** Robust error recovery for production reliability

#### Tool Failure Scenarios & Recovery

| Failure Type | Cause | Recovery Action | Fallback | User Impact |
|--------------|-------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **File not found** | File moved/deleted | Log warning, skip tool | Continue with partial context | Minor - analysis less complete |
| **LSP timeout** | Large project, slow response | Retry once (5s timeout) | Use grep search instead | Minor - slower tool execution |
| **ChromaDB unreachable** | Docker not running, network issue | Retry 3x with exp backoff | Skip vector search, proceed | Minor - no past RCAs retrieved |
| **LLM inference error** | Model crashed, OOM | Retry 3x with exp backoff | Show error, save checkpoint | Major - user must restart |
| **Model OOM** | Model too large for GPU | Auto-switch to smaller model | Use 3B instead of 7B | Minor - slightly less accurate |
| **Prompt too long** | Context exceeds token limit | Chunk context, summarize | Use only critical sections | Minor - less context |
| **Tool execution timeout** | Slow file system, large files | Cancel after 30s, skip | Continue without tool result | Minor - missing one data point |
| **JSON parse error** | LLM output malformed | Retry with stricter prompt | Ask LLM to fix JSON | Minor - one iteration lost |

#### Implementation: Graceful Degradation

```typescript
// src/agent/ReactAgent.ts
export class ReactAgent {
  async analyze(
    errorContext: ErrorContext,
    mode: AnalysisMode = 'standard'
  ): Promise<RCADocument> {
    try {
      return await this.analyzeWithAllTools(errorContext, mode);
    } catch (error) {
      return await this.handleAnalysisError(error, errorContext, mode);
    }
  }
  
  private async handleAnalysisError(
    error: Error,
    errorContext: ErrorContext,
    mode: AnalysisMode
  ): Promise<RCADocument> {
    // 1. Model Out-of-Memory: Switch to smaller model
    if (error instanceof ModelOOMError) {
      this.logger.warn('Model OOM detected, switching to 3B model');
      await this.llm.switchModel('qwen-coder:3b');
      return await this.analyzeWithAllTools(errorContext, mode);
    }
    
    // 2. Context Too Long: Summarize and retry
    if (error instanceof ContextLengthError) {
      this.logger.warn('Context too long, applying summarization');
      const summarized = await this.contextManager.summarize(errorContext);
      return await this.analyzeWithAllTools(summarized, mode);
    }
    
    // 3. Tool Timeouts: Disable slow tools, continue
    if (error instanceof ToolTimeoutError) {
      this.logger.warn(`Tool timeout: ${error.toolName}, disabling for this analysis`);
      this.disableTools([error.toolName]);
      return await this.analyzeWithAllTools(errorContext, mode);
    }
    
    // 4. Vector DB unreachable: Continue without past RCAs
    if (error instanceof VectorDBError) {
      this.logger.warn('Vector DB unreachable, continuing without past RCAs');
      this.disableTools(['vector_search_db']);
      return await this.analyzeWithAllTools(errorContext, mode);
    }
    
    // 5. LLM inference failure: Try different model
    if (error instanceof LLMInferenceError && this.retryCount < 3) {
      this.retryCount++;
      this.logger.warn(`LLM inference failed, retry ${this.retryCount}/3`);
      await this.delay(1000 * this.retryCount);  // Exponential backoff
      return await this.analyzeWithAllTools(errorContext, mode);
    }
    
    // 6. Unrecoverable error: Save checkpoint, inform user
    this.logger.error('Unrecoverable analysis error', error);

    throw new RCAError(
      'Analysis failed. Checkpoint saved - you can resume later.',
      { cause: error, checkpointId: this.currentState.checkpointId }
    );
  }
  
  private disableTools(toolNames: string[]): void {
    this.disabledTools.push(...toolNames);
    this.logger.info(`Disabled tools: ${toolNames.join(', ')}`);
  }
  
  private async delay(ms: number): Promise<void> {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
  }
}
```

#### Checkpoint Recovery Flow

```typescript
// src/agent/StateManager.ts
export class StateManager {
  async resumeFromCheckpoint(checkpointId: string): Promise<AgentState> {
    const checkpoint = await this.loadCheckpoint(checkpointId);
    
    if (!checkpoint) {
      throw new Error(`Checkpoint not found: ${checkpointId}`);
    }
    
    // Validate checkpoint is recent (<24h)
    const age = Date.now() - checkpoint.timestamp;
    if (age > 86400000) {  // 24 hours
      throw new Error('Checkpoint too old, please start fresh analysis');
    }
    
    this.logger.info(`Resuming from iteration ${checkpoint.state.iteration}`);
    return checkpoint.state;
  }
}
```

#### User-Friendly Error Messages

```typescript
// src/ui/ErrorPresenter.ts
export class ErrorPresenter {
  static getUserMessage(error: Error): string {
    if (error instanceof ModelOOMError) {
      return `[WARNING] GPU memory full. Switched to smaller model (3B).\n` +
             `Analysis will be slightly less detailed but still accurate.`;
    }
    
    if (error instanceof VectorDBError) {
      return `[WARNING] Learning database unavailable.\n` +
             `Analysis will continue without past solutions.\n` +
             `Tip: Start ChromaDB with: docker compose up chromadb`;
    }
    
    if (error instanceof ContextLengthError) {
      return `[WARNING] Error context too large for model.\n` +
             `Summarizing code to fit model limits...`;
    }
    
    if (error instanceof RCAError) {
      return `[FAIL] Analysis failed: ${error.message}\n` +
             `Checkpoint saved. Resume with: Cmd+Shift+P → "RCA: Resume Analysis"`;
    }
    
    return `[FAIL] Unexpected error: ${error.message}\n` +
           `Please report this issue on GitHub.`;
  }
}
```

#### Monitoring & Alerting

```typescript
// src/monitoring/HealthCheck.ts
export class HealthCheck {
  async checkSystem(): Promise<SystemHealth> {
    return {
      ollama: await this.checkOllama(),
      chromadb: await this.checkChromaDB(),
      gpu: await this.checkGPU(),

        message: 'Ollama not running. Start with: ollama serve',
        action: 'start_ollama'
      };
    }
  }
  
  private async checkGPU(): Promise<ServiceStatus> {
    // Check NVIDIA GPU availability
    try {
      const { exec } = require('child_process');
      await exec('nvidia-smi');
      return { status: 'healthy', message: 'GPU available' };

### Week 12: Deployment & Documentation

#### Milestone 3.4 - Production Release

**Deliverable:** Published extension + comprehensive docs

| Task | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| **Performance Optimization** | • Result caching (hash-based deduplication)<br>• Parallel tool execution<br>• Context window management<br>• Model selection (7B/3B based on complexity) |

#### Performance Optimization Deep Dive

**1. Result Caching Strategy**
```typescript
// src/cache/ErrorHasher.ts
export class ErrorHasher {
  static hash(error: ParsedError): string {
    // Create signature from error characteristics
    const signature = {
      type: error.type,
      message: this.normalizeMessage(error.message),
      file: path.basename(error.filePath),  // Just filename, not full path
      language: error.language,
      // Don't include line number (too specific)
      // Don't include timestamps
    };
    return createHash('sha256')
      .update(JSON.stringify(signature))
      .digest('hex');
  }
  
  private static normalizeMessage(msg: string): string {
    // Remove variable names, line numbers, timestamps
    return msg
      .replace(/\d+/g, 'N')  // Numbers → N
      .replace(/\b\w{8,}\b/g, 'VAR')  // Long words (var names) → VAR
      .replace(/at line \d+/g, 'at line N')
      .toLowerCase();
  }
}

// Example: Both errors hash to same signature
// "NullPointerException at line 42 in fetchUserData"
// "NullPointerException at line 87 in getUserProfile"
// Both → "nullpointerexception at line N in VAR"
```

**2. Context Window Management**
```typescript
// src/agent/ContextWindowManager.ts
export class ContextWindowManager {
  async prepareContext(
    files: string[], 
    focusLine: number,
    maxTokens: number = 6000  // 7B models: 4K-8K tokens
  ): Promise<string> {
    // Strategy:
    // 1. Always include: error location + 100 lines (critical)
    // 2. Extract: all function signatures from file
    // 3. Add: caller functions (via LSP)
    // 4. Summarize: remaining code (with LLM if needed)
    
    const critical = await this.extractCriticalSection(files[0], focusLine, 100);
    const signatures = await this.extractSignatures(files);
    const callers = await this.findCallers(files[0], focusLine);
    
    let context = [
      '=== Critical Section (Error Location) ===',
      critical,
      '',
      '=== Function Signatures ===',
      signatures,
      '',
      '=== Caller Functions ===',
      callers,
    ].join('\n');
    
    // If still too large, summarize
    const estimatedTokens = this.estimateTokens(context);
    if (estimatedTokens > maxTokens) {
      const targetLength = Math.floor(context.length * (maxTokens / estimatedTokens));
      context = await this.summarizeWithLLM(context, targetLength);
    }
    
    return context;
  }
  
  private estimateTokens(text: string): number {
    // Rough estimate: 1 token ≈ 4 characters
    return Math.ceil(text.length / 4);
  }
  
  private async extractSignatures(files: string[]): Promise<string> {
    const signatures = [];
    
    for (const file of files) {
      const content = await readFile(file);
      // Extract function declarations using regex
      const funcPattern = /(fun|class|interface)\s+\w+\s*\([^)]*\)/g;
      const matches = content.match(funcPattern) || [];
      signatures.push(...matches);
    }
    
    return signatures.join('\n');
  }
}
```

**3. Parallel Tool Execution**
```typescript
// src/agent/ParallelToolExecutor.ts
export class ParallelToolExecutor {
  async executeParallel(toolCalls: ToolCall[]): Promise<ToolResult[]> {
    // Build dependency graph
    const graph = this.buildDependencyGraph(toolCalls);
    
    // Find independent tools (no dependencies)
    const independent = toolCalls.filter(t => !graph.hasDependencies(t));
    const dependent = toolCalls.filter(t => graph.hasDependencies(t));
    
    // Execute independent tools in parallel
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
      independent.map(tool => this.executeSingle(tool))
    );
    
    // Extract successful results, log failures
    const successfulResults = results
      .filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled')
      .map(r => (r as PromiseFulfilledResult<ToolResult>).value);
    
    // Execute dependent tools sequentially
    for (const tool of dependent) {
      try {
        const result = await this.executeSingle(tool);
        successfulResults.push(result);
      } catch (error) {
        this.logger.warn(`Tool ${tool.name} failed: ${error.message}`);
      }
    }
    
    return successfulResults;
  }
  
  private buildDependencyGraph(tools: ToolCall[]): DependencyGraph {
    // Example: find_callers depends on read_file
    const dependencies = new Map<string, string[]>();
    
    tools.forEach(tool => {
      if (tool.name === 'find_callers') {
        dependencies.set(tool.name, ['read_file']);
      } else if (tool.name === 'symbol_search') {
        dependencies.set(tool.name, []);
      }
      // ... more dependency rules
    });
    
    return new DependencyGraph(dependencies);
  }
}

// Example: 3 tools, 2 independent
// Sequential: read_file (2s) + find_callers (3s) + symbol_search (2s) = 7s
// Parallel: [read_file (2s), symbol_search (2s)] + find_callers (3s) = 5s
// Speedup: 40%
```

**4. Monitoring Dashboard**
```typescript
// src/monitoring/MetricsCollector.ts
export interface PerformanceMetrics {
  // Analysis metrics
  total_analyses: number;
  avg_duration_ms: number;
  p50_duration_ms: number;
  p90_duration_ms: number;
  p99_duration_ms: number;
  
  // Tool metrics
  tool_executions: Record<string, {

  cache_misses: number;
  cache_hit_rate: number;
  
  // Quality metrics
  avg_confidence: number;
  user_helpful_rate: number;  // % of "helpful" feedback
}

export class MetricsCollector {
  async collectMetrics(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics> {
    // Aggregate from logs/database
    const analyses = await this.db.getAnalyses();
    
    return {
      total_analyses: analyses.length,
      avg_duration_ms: this.average(analyses.map(a => a.duration)),
      p50_duration_ms: this.percentile(analyses.map(a => a.duration), 0.5),
      p90_duration_ms: this.percentile(analyses.map(a => a.duration), 0.9),
      // ... rest of metrics
