### Collection Script (To Be Implemented)
```bash
# Generate weekly metrics report
npm run generate-metrics

# This will:
# 1. Count files/LOC via cloc
# 2. Extract test coverage from Jest
# 3. Parse performance benchmark results
# 4. Query git log for commits
# 5. Update this file with new data
```

### Integration with CI/CD
- Metrics collected on every PR merge
- Weekly reports emailed/posted automatically
- Regression alerts for performance degradation

## Automated Metrics Collection

### Collection Script (To Be Implemented)
```bash
# Generate weekly metrics report
npm run generate-metrics

# This will:
# 1. Count files/LOC via cloc
# 2. Extract test coverage from Jest
# 3. Parse performance benchmark results
# 4. Query git log for commits
# 5. Update this file with new data
```

### Integration with CI/CD
- Metrics collected on every PR merge
- Weekly reports emailed/posted automatically
- Regression alerts for performance degradation
