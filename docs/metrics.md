- ADR 003: ChromaDB for Vector Storage (documented in DEVLOG.md)

*Note: Formal ADR documents to be created in Week 1*

### Blockers & Risks
- **None currently**

### Month 1 Goals (Foundation Phase)
- [ ] Initialize TypeScript extension project
- [ ] Implement local LLM integration (Ollama with <10B param models)
- [ ] Set up ChromaDB with Docker for persistent learning
- [ ] Create evaluation framework for measuring hypotheses
- [ ] Build tool infrastructure (read_file, LSP integration)
- [ ] Design benchmark dataset (200+ errors across TypeScript + Python)
- [ ] Test multiple model sizes (3B-8B range) for performance profiling
- [ ] Write unit tests (target: >80% coverage)

## Automated Metrics Collection

### Collection Script (To Be Implemented)
```bash
# Generate weekly metrics report
npm run generate-metrics

# This will:
# 1. Count files/LOC via cloc
# 2. Extract test coverage from Jest
# 3. Parse performance benchmark results
# 4. Query git log for commits
# 5. Update this file with new data
```

### Integration with CI/CD
- Metrics collected on every PR merge
- Weekly reports emailed/posted automatically
- Regression alerts for performance degradation
